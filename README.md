## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Build real-world SOC Analyst skills
- Practice using SIEMs, log analysis, and incident response
- Complete cybersecurity labs and document findings

|   Risk Management   | Identifying, analyzing, and mitigating risks that could impact systems or data          |

## ðŸ“… Day 2 â€“ Risk Response Strategy

| **Risk Response Strategy** | **Description** | **Example** |
|----------------------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Acceptance**   | The organization acknowledges the risk and is prepared to handle any consequences. | A company knows a new product may have some defects but launches it anyway, ready to fix issues if they arise                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Reduction**    | Steps are taken to minimize the risk by lowering its likelihood or impact.         | A business installs security software to reduce the chance of cyberattacks  |
| **Transference** | The risk is shifted to another party to manage its impact.                         | A company buys insurance to cover potential financial losses from accidents |
| **Rejection**    | The organization avoids the risk entirely by changing its operations.              | A firm stops selling a risky product to prevent future liabilities          |
